# GameEngine-Java🎮

## Overview
This is a 2D Game Engine Library developed by me, without external dependencies.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this 2D Game Engine stems from a desire to understand the inner workings of larger, more abstract engines like Unity. I felt that the abstraction in such engines sometimes obscured the essence of what a game engine truly is. Thus, I embarked on developing my own game engine in the form of a Java library, aiming to encompass the fundamental methods and classes required for 2D game development.

## ⚙️Quick Setup⚙️
### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
```shell
Note: JDK 20 (including JRE 20 and Development Tools) is required for the engine to function properly.
```

## 🔧The repository comprises the following main components:

* Engine:
Contains classes essential for creating your game, such as input handling, rendering, and the game loop.

* Game: 
Includes the GameManager, responsible for managing game updates and rendering objects like images and image tiles.
