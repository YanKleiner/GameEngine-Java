# GameEngine-Java

This is a 2D Game Engine made by me without any external libaries

->Engine: contains the classes that can be used for creating your game like input, Renderer, Game Loop
->game :  contains the GameManager (update method :that updates with a customizable frame rate + render method for rendering objects like an Image/ImageTile)
