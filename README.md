# GameEngine-Java🎮

## Overview
This is a 2D Game Engine Library developed by me, without external dependencies.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this 2D Game Engine stems from a desire to understand the inner workings of larger, more abstract engines like Unity. The creator felt that the abstraction in such engines sometimes obscured the essence of what a game engine truly is. Thus, they embarked on developing their own game engine in the form of a Java library, aiming to encompass the fundamental methods and classes required for 2D game development.
