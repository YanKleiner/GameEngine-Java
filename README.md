#' This is a 2D Game Engine Libary made by me without any external libaries

#Why an own 2D Game Engine?
All of the time ive been wondering how big and abstract Game Engines like Unity Work. 
For me it seemed like the abstraction kind of stole the essence of what a game Engine actually is.
So i decided to code my own Game Engine in the form of a libary in Java that includes the basic methods and classes needed for 2D Games to work.


Quick Setup: 
*Clone The repository on your own device: 
'''shell
git clone https://github.com/YanKleiner/GameEngine-Java.git 
'''
-IMPORTANT: JDK 20 (JRE 20, amd Development Tools of JDK) are required for it to work
* Open Game Engine in your prefered IDE!
* 

->Engine: contains the classes that can be used for creating your game like input, Renderer, Game Loop
->game :  contains the GameManager (update method :that updates with a customizable frame rate + render method for rendering objects like an Image/ImageTile) 

JDK Version: 20.01
